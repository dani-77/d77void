d77void is created using void-mklive:
https://github.com/void-linux/void-mklive

It includes my usual set of applications, all present in the official Void repos;
(the exceptions are dwm and hyprland isos, in which I had to compile some of the suckless tools or add extra repo to provide the visual and behaviour achieved)

Built with Void; all the apps of Void repos are available to be installed.

It is built in 6 flavors:
fluxbox, labwc (wayland) and openbox - All of them are ideal wm for new users and advanced users, being lightweight and with many features at the same time.
dwm, hyprland (wayland) and sway (wayland) - targeting advanced users, that want to customize their desktop and prefer the keyboard instead of mouse.

There are two users:
anon
root
In both cases the password is voidlinux

Installation:
Type sudo void-installer in a terminal and choose local install to preserve live configs.
