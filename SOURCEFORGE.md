d77void is created using void-mklive:
https://github.com/void-linux/void-mklive

It includes my usual set of applications, all present in the official Void repos; 
(the exception is dwm iso, in which I had to compile some of the suckless tools to provide the visual and behaviour achieved)
among them is abiword, gnumeric, zathura, nextcloud-desktop, cmus, mpv, ncspot, github-cli and many more.

Because it is built with Void, all the repo apps of Void are available to be installed.

It is built in three flavors:
fluxbox and openbox - Both are wm and are ideal for new users and advanced users, being lightweight and with many features at the same time.
dwm - targeting advanced users, that want to customize their desktop and prefer the keyboard instead of mouse.

There are two users:
anon
root
In both cases the password is voidlinux

Installation:
Type sudo void-installer in a terminal and choose local install to preserve live configs.
