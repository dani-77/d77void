Hello
Thank you for trying d77void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 
To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.

# Calamares

Added Calamares installer to dwm ISO as well; 

To use it open a terminal and

```
su

calamares
```

## Keybinds

alt + return -> terminal

alt + shift + e -> logout

alt + shift + q -> close window

alt + d -> rofi

alt + x -> powermenu

Have fun!
