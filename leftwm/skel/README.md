Hello
Thank you for trying d77void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 
To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.

# Calamares

Added Calamares installer to the ISO as well; 

To use it open a terminal and

```
calamares
```

## Keybinds

super + return -> terminal

super + shift + x -> logout

super + shift + q -> close window

super + a -> rofi

super + x -> powermenu

super + b -> web browser

super + f -> pcmanfm

super + l -> slock

super + m -> geary

super + p -> scrot

Have fun!
