Hello Thank you for trying d77void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.

# NEWS

Now Calamares installer is available making the install process even simpler.

I would like to thank Calamares team, Kevin Figueroa (Cereus Linux) and johna1 (F-Void Linux) for all the work done and guidance.

I would like to express my gratitude and say a big thank you to Rúben Gomez (Youtube channel Ruben_&_Linux_:~) for all the encouragement.

To install with Calamares:

```
calamares
```

# 1st run:

After install, run the script d77-welcome:

```
d77-welcome
```

That way the hyprland repo will be added to /etc/xbps.d
