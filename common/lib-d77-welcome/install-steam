  repos are. Would you like to install it now? If you choose to do 
  this, the following packages will be installed:
  
   xbps-install -S steam libgcc-32bit libstdc++-32bit libdrm-32bit
   libglvnd-32bit mesa-32bit mesa-dri-32bit
   
  Note: additional packages listed as dependencies will also be installed."
