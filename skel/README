Hello
Thank you for trying d77Void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
# sudo void-installer
```

During install, please choose local install instead of network install.

To be able to use udiskie to automount disks, add your user to the storage group.
After install, to make powermenu work properly run:

```
# sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/poweroff
# sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/reboot
```

That way, even the non privileged user can use the powermenu.

Hope you enjoy!
