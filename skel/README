Hello
Thank you for trying d77Void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

sudo void-installer

Note: 
To mantain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.
During install, add your user to the storage group to be able to use udiskie to automount disks.


1st run:

After install, to make powermenu work properly run:

sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/poweroff
sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/reboot

That way, even the non privileged user can use the powermenu.

To tweak conky, edit .conkyrc; you will need to change local to be able to have weather running on it with your city instead of mine.
Probably you will need to change the wifi card device to display properly the info.
In case battery is not working properly, swap BAT0 to BAT1 this way; open a terminal and type:

sed -i 's|BAT0|BAT1|' .conkyrc

To edit and customize your fluxbox variables, like menu, wallpaper and startup applications, go to ~/.fluxbox/ and edit the files in there to fit your needs.

Have fun!
