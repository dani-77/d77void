Hello
Thank you for trying d77Void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo void-installer
```

Note: 
To mantain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.
During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.


# 1st run:

After install, to make powermenu work properly run:

```
sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/poweroff
sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/reboot
```

That way, even non privileged users can use powermenu.

To tweak conky, edit .conkyrc; you will need to change local to be able to have weather running on it with your city instead of mine.
Probably you will need to change the wifi card device name to display properly the info.
Check wich device name this way:

```
ip a
```
The one with w??? is the correct name. Change it this way:

```
# sed -i 's|wlp21s0|w???|' .conkyrc
```

In case battery is not working properly, swap BAT0 to BAT1 this way; open a terminal and type:

```
sed -i 's|BAT0|BAT1|' .conkyrc
```

To edit and customize your fluxbox variables, like menu, wallpaper and startup applications, go to ~/.fluxbox/ and edit the files in there to fit your needs.

Have fun!
