# d77void WM void editions

d77void intend to be a friendly general use OS based on 
Void GNU/Linux with an WM pre configured.

All the variants are very light and with just some apps 
installed.

I started this project for myself, and so, the first ISOS 
had my common apps installed, but right now almost every 
ISO has just the bare essential, giving you the chance to 
install just what you need.

It is distributed in three X11 WM and three Wayland WM. 
The lightest in memory usage is dwm and fluxbox (both X11) 
and the more resource hungry are Openbox and Labwc.

The easiest to go out of the box is Openbox, Labwc and in my 
opinion dwm (even though not the easiest to configure).

Hyprland is the more bleeding edge, even needs to have an extra 
repository because it is not yet distributed in Void. As so, 
see this ISO as highly experimental; it shouldn't happen, but 
things can get break.

## 1st run

In all the Wayland variants, I suggest to run a script named 
1strun; it isn't crucial, but running it will chnge the SDDM 
theme to something more in line with my vision. In the Hyprland 
variant creates the extra repo as well.

## Help

In case of need, I have a Discord server with a channel for each 
variant of the OS. It is the easiest way to get some help from 
me.


Have fun!
