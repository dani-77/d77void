# d77void - WM void editions

d77void intend to be a friendly general use OS based on 
Void GNU/Linux with a Window Manager pre configured.

All the variants are very light and with just some apps 
installed.

## 1st run

In all the Wayland variants, I suggest to run a script named 
1strun; it isn't crucial, but running it will change the SDDM 
theme to something more in line with my vision. In the Hyprland 
variant creates the extra repo as well.

## Help

In case of need, I have a Discord server with a channel for each 
variant of the OS. It is the easiest way to get some help from 
me.

Have fun!
