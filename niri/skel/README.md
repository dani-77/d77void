Hello
Thank you for trying d77void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 

To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.

To install with Calamares:

```
su

calamares
```

## Keybinds

super + return -> terminal

super + b -> web browser

super + d -> fuzzel

super + shift + e -> logout

super + o -> gmrun

super + p -> file manager

super + q -> close window

## niri tweaks

To alter the autostart programs, add/swap keybinds and keyboard layout configure ~/.config/niri/config.kdl ; the file is self explanatory and with several examples already configured.

Have fun!
