Hello
Thank you for trying d77void.

## **Very Important**

To achieve the configuration I intended do distribute, please run:

```
niri_1st
```

Only that way you will see what the system is intended to look.


## Installer

To install with Calamares:

```
su

calamares
```

To run the tui installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 

To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.


## Keybinds

super + return -> terminal

super + b -> web browser

super + d -> fuzzel

super + shift + e -> logout

super + o -> gmrun

super + p -> file manager

super + q -> close window

## niri tweaks

To alter the autostart programs, add/swap keybinds and keyboard layout configure ~/.config/niri/config.kdl ; the file is self explanatory and with several examples already configured.

Have fun!
