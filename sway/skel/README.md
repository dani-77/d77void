Hello
Thank you for trying d77void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 
To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.

# NEWS

Now Calamares installer is available making the install process even simpler.

I would like to thank Calamares team, Kevin Figueroa (Cereus Linux) and johna1 (F-Void Linux) for all the work done and guidance.

I would like to express my gratitude and say a big thank you to RÃºben Gomez (Youtube channel Ruben_&_Linux_:~) for all the encouragement.

## Keybinds

super + return -> terminal

super + b -> swap wallpaper

super + d -> wmenu

super + p -> rofi

super + o -> gmrun

super + x -> powermenu

super + shift + e -> logout

super + shift + c -> reload sway config

super + shift + q -> close window

super + r -> resize window

## Sway tweaks

To alter the autostart programs, add/swap keybinds and keyboard layout configure ~/.config/sway/config ; the file is self explanatory and with several examples already configured.

Have fun!
