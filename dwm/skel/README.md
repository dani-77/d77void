Hello
Thank you for trying d77void.

To run the installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo void-installer
```

Note: 
To mantain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.


# 1st run:

## Keybinds

alt + shift + return -> terminal

alt + shift + q -> logout

alt + shift + c -> close window

alt + t -> tile mode

alt + f -> floating mode

alt + m -> focus mode

alt + d -> rofi

alt + p -> dmenu

alt + x -> powermenu

alt + w -> firefox

super + f -> pcmanfm

super + l -> slock

super + m -> geary

super + p -> scrot

## Suckless directory

Inside this directory you have all the source code used to compile the programs from suckless, from the window manager (dwm) to a web surfer that is not installed in the iso (surf).
All the dependencies are already installed in the iso, so, it is just a matter of compile and adapt to your needs.

Have fun!
